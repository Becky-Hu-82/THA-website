        The TreeHouse Academia (THA) was founded in the summer of 2018 by a
        group of philanthropic driven young professionals. The THA team share a
        common belief that young learners around the globe should have equal
        access to education without the barriers of wealth and social classes.
        The THA thrives to nourish the education dreams of underprivileged
        teenagers by constructing a platform for Chinese international students
        around the globe to donate funds, purchase educational accessories, and
        gain social hands-on experience by visiting schools and students in
        rural China to ensure equal education for all.
