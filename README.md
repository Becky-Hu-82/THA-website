# Before you start

Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and yarn installed.

# General commands

## install all packages

```
yarn install
```

## start the app

```
yarn start
```

## deploy the website

```
yarn deploy
```

This command will build all the changes into the `/build` folder, sync the changes in the `/build` folder on the `gh-pages` branch, and deploy the `gh-pages` branch.

### Notes

- The `gh-pages` branch is autogenerated. Never delete this branch.
- If the website doesn't show up, try going on the `gh-pages` branch and find a file named `CNAME`, and make sure it's saying `www.treehouseacademia.org` rather than `treehouseacademia.org`. If there's no such file, manually add it.
